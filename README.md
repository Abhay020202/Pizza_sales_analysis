## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Pizza Sales Analysis  

This project involves analyzing pizza sales data to gain critical business insights and improve decision-making. The analysis focuses on identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizing trends using SQL and Power BI.

## Problem Statement
We aim to analyze pizza sales data and derive actionable insights to enhance performance. The following KPIs need to be calculated:

- **Total Revenue**: Total price of all pizza orders.
- **Average Order Value**: Average spending per order, calculated as total revenue divided by the total number of orders.
- **Total Pizzas Sold**: Sum of quantities of all pizzas sold.
- **Total Orders**: Total number of orders placed.
- **Average Pizzas Per Order**: Total pizzas sold divided by the total number of orders.

## Charts Requirement
The following visualizations were created to explore sales data trends:

- **Daily Trend for Total Orders**: A bar chart showing daily order volume trends.
- **Monthly Trend for Total Orders**: A line chart illustrating order trends by month.
- **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**: A pie chart highlighting the popularity of pizza categories based on sales contributions.
- **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**: A pie chart showing sales distribution across pizza sizes.
- **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category**: A funnel chart comparing category performance based on total pizzas sold.
- **Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders**: A bar chart identifying the most popular pizzas.
- **Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders**: A bar chart revealing the least popular pizzas.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For querying and extracting insights from the dataset.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations and presenting analysis results.

## Insights

 **Key Trends**
  
- **Busy Times**: Peak sales occur on Friday and Saturday evenings, with July and January showing the highest monthly orders.
- **Daily and Monthly Trends**: Orders are steady during weekdays and spike on weekends, with seasonal variations observed in key months.

**Performance Highlights**

- **Top Sellers**: Thai Chicken Pizza leads in revenue; Classic Deluxe Pizza excels in both total orders and quantities sold.
- **Underperformers**: Brie Carré Pizza shows weak performance across revenue, orders, and quantity; consider revising or replacing it.

**Customer Preferences**

- **Categories**: Classic pizzas are most popular and contribute the highest sales.
- **Sizes**: Large pizzas dominate, reflecting group dining preferences.

**Opportunities**

- **Focus**: Leverage popular items like Thai Chicken and Classic Deluxe for promotions and upselling.
- **Improve**: Revise or replace underperforming items like Brie Carré Pizza.
- **Optimize**: Align staffing and inventory to peak sales days and months for efficient operations.

## Conclusion
- This project provides a comprehensive overview of pizza sales performance through KPIs and visualizations. These insights provide a roadmap for understanding customer preferences, maximizing revenue, and refining operational strategies. Leveraging this data with targeted marketing campaigns and optimizing product offerings will drive sustained growth for the business.
